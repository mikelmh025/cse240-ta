<h3>Data</h3>
<p>The datasets are downloadable from the <a href="#participate-get_data" data-toggle="tab">Dataset page</a>.</p>
<h3>Code Submission</h3>
<p>The participants must submit a zip file with their code via the <a href="#participate-submit_results" data-toggle="tab">Submission page</a>.</p>
<h4>Submission format</h4>
<p>The final submission format is:</p>
<p>submission.zip</p>
<ul>
<li>boostit.py</li>
<li>other python scripts you wrote</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that to create a valid submission, zip all the file with 'zip -r zipfilename *' starting from this directory. <strong>DO NOT zip the directory itself, just its contents. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT.</strong> <br /> <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/a2ahv2qh7solhhn/run.py?dl=0">Here</a> is a sample run.py file. The participants must submit a run.py with the exactly same format.</p>
<h4>Computational restrictions</h4>
<p>For both phases, the prescribed "time budget" is 300 seconds, including both the running time of your code and the evaluation time of the predicted results. In other words, the running time of your program must be less than 300 seconds.</p>
