<h2>Terms and Conditions</h2>
<p>This competition is only for UCSC students enrolled into the CS142 course. <br /> We follow UCSC&rsquo;s academic integrity policy from UCSC Campus Regulations, Chapter VII: &ldquo;Student Conduct and Discipline&rdquo;): <br /> <em>&ldquo;It is expected that students attending the University of California understand and subscribe to the ideal of academic integrity, and are willing to bear individual responsibility for their work. Any work (written or otherwise) submitted to fulfill an academic requirement must represent a student&rsquo;s original work. Any act of academic dishonesty, such as cheating or plagiarism, will subject a person to University disciplinary action. Using or attempting to use materials, information, study aids, or commercial &ldquo;research&rdquo; services not authorized by the instructor of the course constitutes cheat- ing. Representing the words, ideas, or concepts of another person without appropriate attribution is plagiarism. Whenever another person&rsquo;s written work is utilized, whether it be a single phrase or longer, quotation marks must be used and sources cited. Paraphrasing another&rsquo;s work, i.e., bor- rowing the ideas or concepts and putting them into one&rsquo;s &ldquo;own&rdquo; words, must also be acknowledged. Although a person&rsquo;s state of mind and intention will be considered in determining the University response to an act of academic dishonesty, this in no way lessens the responsibility of the student.&rdquo;</em></p>
