One can easily imagine actions with high negative cost, even in domains such as route finding.

Can you think of a real domain in which step costs are such as to cause looping?\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"0Icb-HO7Wi_W"},"source":["YOUR ANSWERS HERE\n","\n","a. The reason why having large negative costs for successful actions is an issue for optimality searched by an algorithm relies on the fact that these large negative costs can skew the optimal path to be a different path that isn't followed by a search algorithm unless the entire state space is explored. For example, consider the graph below: \n","\n","![](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1St06nwIG-YxYWLArp1gwvxwXOaTFUTav)\n","\n","If we used a search algorithm that didn't explore the entire state space, the algorithm could have chosen Start -> Goal as it's path. However, we can see that arbitary low cost at d -> Goal toward the end of the goal skews the optimal path to be an alternative route: Start -> a -> c -> d -> Goal. This path is only found after exploring the entire search space.\n","\n","b. For a state graph, having arbitarily negative values with a cost at least greater than a constant c would still be an issue since it doesn't solve our problem where the search algorithm would find a path that isn't optimal because there's another path with a negative cumulative cost less than the one found, all due to step costs later in the search graph that skew another direction to be optimal. You would still need the algorithm to explore the entire state space. \n","\n","c. The repercussions of having a set of actions that leads to a loop, where each step has a negative cost, is that the agent would follow this path and be stuck at this infinite state forever, since the path to this loop is cheap as the step costs are negative.\n","\n","d. In the context of state-space search, humans don't drive around scenic routes indefinitely because they don't often want to view a particular scenic route many times in their journey. For example, if I'm planning a route from Los Angeles to San Fransisco, I wouldn't want to explore Santa Cruz multiple times along the way in route to San Fransisco. To avoid this problem, we can add an additional incremental cost for every time we visit a particular place, to avoid visiting a place many times, as there is a higher cumulative cost for visiting a place each successive time.\n","\n","e. A real domain situation where step costs would cause looping is deciding what times to drink water everyday, assuming no strenuous exercise and constant body conditions. The model would be stuck at wanting us to drink water every hour or so and thus be looping in that cycle. \n"]}]}
